Today, section was not required for students that had already completed:
* jpa00 (which was everyone)
* jspa01 (which was 20/68 students)

Everyone else was encouraged to logon to the zoom room, work on the lab, and ask for help as needed.

(This is similar to how the class would have been conducted if we were doing in-person instruction.)
