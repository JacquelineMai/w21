# What can we do?

Well, the course description says:

<div class="card" style="width: 50rem;">
<div class="card-body" markdown="1">
<h5 class="card-title">CMPSC 56</h5>

Advanced Applications Programming (4) CONRAD

*Prerequisite: Computer Science 24 and 32 with a grade of C or better*

<p class="card-text">
Advanced application programming using a high-level, virtual-machine-based language. Topics include generic programming, exception handling, programming language implementation; automatic memory management, and application development, management, and maintenance tools; event handling, concurrency and threading, and advanced library use.

A few observations:
* Note that it says nothing about Java, per se, but it's always been understood to be the department's "Java course".
* But, Java as a means to an end, not as the end goal

What is the goal?
* Applications Programming
* That includes a lot more than just Java

Here's a link list of some of the things it includes
* <https://ucsb-cs56.github.io/topics/applications_programming/>
* I made this list together with folks at AppFolio, a local software employer
* A lot of that stuff won't be in the textbooks!
