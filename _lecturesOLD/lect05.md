# Java Tutorials: The Student class

In place of lecture today, I've prepared a set of eight Java tutorials here.  You are encouraged to read through them.  

* <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/tutorials/student>

I'll also be preparing video 
lectures to go along with them; these lecture may expand on the material in the written tutorials.    

There will be more written tutorials and videos in this series coming soon.

If you are new to Java, you should also **read Chapters 3 and 4 in Head First Java 2nd edition** either before, or along with reading these tutorials.  These chapters
cover the difference between primitive and reference variables, which is something that comes up in these tutorials and in the new lab.

# New Programming Assignment

There is also a new programming assignment here:
* <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/f20/lab/jpa01>

This assignment covers JUnit, test coverage and mutation testing as applied to Java programming.  While you may be use to writing code, you may not be as used to writing
your own test cases. That turns out to be a pretty important skill for real world software development, so are emphasizing it throughout the course.

If you are finished with jspa01, you are encouraged to start on jpa01 right away. 

# Videos on Connecting with Samba

* The slack has a channel [#videos](https://ucsb-cs156-f20.slack.com/archives/C01C3D5L9GS) where I'll be posting links to YouTube Videos
* There is also a [YouTube channel for CMPSC 156](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV4o6EPzA4JxH-82NZl20Cg) you can subscribe to
