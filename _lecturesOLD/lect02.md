# The course website

Here: <https://ucsb-cs56.github.io>

Note the two parts:
* Permanent part for CS56
* The part for /w20/ specifically

# Where is the syllabus?

It's here.  We're saving some trees.

* <https://ucsb-cs56.github.io/w20/info/syllabus/>

# The special circumstances that led to two lectures

* I'm teaching an extra lecture section
* This is a voluntary service I'm doing for no extra compensation
* Why?
   * The altrusitic reason: I want to help students that were stranded due to poor resource planning
   * The selfish reason: a class larger than 72 doesn't work for this style of teaching

# My special passion: Teaching real world software practice

Why is this course different from all other courses?

Because as a young software developer I saw a gap between what I learned in school, and what i needed in industry.
