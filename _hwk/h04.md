Reading Assignment (for the entire assignment)

Read and HFJ7 and HFJ8, along with the online reading notes that go with those chapters:

* https://ucsb-cs56.github.io/hfj/HFJ_Chapter_7/
* https://ucsb-cs56.github.io/hfj/HFJ_Chapter_8/


Also, in  JN7 Chapter 4, read just the first section on **interfaces**.
This updates some of the elements of HFJ's treatment of interfaces that is out of date, updating it for Java 11.   You may stop (for this assignment) when you get to the header **Generics**.n

Then, do the problems on Gradescope.
