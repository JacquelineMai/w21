NOT READY YET!!!!   NOT READY YET !!!

PLEASE WAIT UNTIL THIS IS MARKED AS READY!!!

IF YOU START NOW, YOU'LL RUN INTO PROBLEMS.  PLEASE WAIT.

In this lab:

* New concepts:
   - Sorting using lambda functions
* More on:
   -   using packages
   -   writing your own JUnit tests
   -   test coverage

Step-by-Step
============

# Step 0: Set up your repo

Create your repo
   * under the <tt>{{page.org}}</tt> organization
   * name should be <tt>{{page.num}}-githubid</tt> OR <tt>{{page.num}}-githubid1-githubid2</tt> as appropriate
   * **private**, and initially *empty* (no README.md, .gitignore or LICENSE).
   * if applicable add your pair partner as a collaborator
     
Clone this empty repo into your `~/cs56` directory, or wherever you prefer to work.

Also clone this repo as a "sibling" (i.e. side by side in the same directory) with your {{page.num}} repo:
* <tt>git clone {{page.starter_repo}}</tt>

Your starter code will be your <tt>{{page.prev_num}}</tt> repo, with a small number of additional files from: <tt>{{page.starter_repo}}</tt>.  So we'll define a remote for your <tt>{{page.prev_num}}</tt> repo:

 
<tt>git remote add {{page.prev_num}} git@github.com:{{page.github_org}}/{{page.prev_num}}-cgaucho1-ldelplaya22.git</tt>
   
Pull from your <tt>{{page.prev_num}}</tt> repo into your <tt>{{page.num}}</tt> repo, and then push to github.


<tt>git pull {{page.prev_num}} master</tt><br />
<tt>git push origin master</tt>
  

Now, we'll copy a few files from the <{{page.starter_repo}}> repo into your new {{page.num}} repo.  That's described in Step 1 below.


# Step 1: Copy code for a new class and a new set of tests into your repo.

Though there is starter code for this week, it is not a full repo; instead it
has just a few that you need to copy to their
proper spots.  In that repo, <{{page.starter_repo}}>, you'll find these files:

| File | Where to copy it in your {{page.num}} repo |
|------|----------|
| `Menu.java` | `src/main/java/edu/ucsb/cs56/pconrad/menuitem` |
| `MenuTest.java` | `src/test/java/edu/ucsb/cs56/pconrad/menuitem` |

It is **important** that you copy `Menu.java` under <tt>src/<b>main</b>/java/...</tt> and `MenuTest.java` under  <tt>src/<b>test</b>/java/...</tt>&mdash;if you don't, you'll have trouble compiling the test code.  You'll get errors
saying that `org.junit` is not defined, etc.    So pay attention to this detail.

To copy these to their proper spots, you could do any of the following.  How you get the file there is up to you.   At this point, you will be expected to have the skills to do that, but if you need some suggestions, here you go:

1. If you cloned this repo to another directory (not  inside of your {{page.num}} repo directory, but as a sibling, for example), then you can use the Unix `cp` or `mv` file to copy the file into it's proper spot.
2. Another approch is to use the "raw" tab on the github site to expose a version of the file that doesn't have any extra formatting (line numbers, etc.).  Then any of the following techniques:
   * Use "save as" in your web browser to save a copy into the correct directory
   * Copy the URL, then cd into the target directory, and use <tt>wget <i>url</i></tt> to get the file.
   * Open the target filename in an editor as an empty file, and use copy/paste to paste in the contents.
   

# Step 2: Start writing code to make tests pass

In the previous lab, {{page.prev_num}}, you implemented several methods of a class called `MenuItem` that represents
item on a restaurant Menu.   Now, we will implement the `Menu` class.   The details about the `Menu` class appear below.

In lecture, we recently discussed `java.lang.Comparable`, `java.util.Comparator`, 
and Java lambda expressions.  You'll need that information.  If you missed it, read this article, which outlines
what we covered:

* <https://ucsb-cs56-pconrad.github.io/topics/java_sorting/>


Just like in the previous lab ({{page.prev_num}}), note that the starter code:
* Has stubs for SOME of the needed methods, but NOT ALL of them
* Has unit tests for SOME of the needed methods, but NOT ALL of them

I suggest that you work in this order:
* **First**, look over the test code in `MenuTest.java`
   * Understand what the tests are doing.
   * Compare this with the list of methods that you are supposed to implement in this lab description.
   * Pay attention especially to this line of code:
     ```java
         private String nl = System.lineSeparator();
     ```
    
     This defines `nl` as the *line separator*, i.e. the character(s) that occur(s) between new lines.  As it turns out,
     this is *system dependent* (it may be different on Mac, Windows and Unix.).  So it is important to implement line
     breaks between items in
     the same way that they are going to be tested.  
  
* **Then, Add stubs in `Menu.java` for all of the methods that don't have them yet.**  
   * Until you do this, you won't be able to run any of the instructor unit tests on Gradescope.
   * The reasons is that the instructor tests won't compile against your code unless and until you have those methods.
* <b>Then, try submitting on Gradescope</b>
   * At this point, you should have a clean compile for both the student and instructor code, though you won't be passing most of the unit tests.
* Then, one at a time, work on each method
   * If the method doesn't have a unit test yet, <b>write the test first and see it fail</b>.
   * Then make the test pass.
   * Then submit on Gradescope and see if the test for that method passes on Gradescope
   * Continue until all of your methods work.

Additional Hints:

1.  You may find it helpful to declare private instance variables for these `Comparator<MenuItem>` objects:

    ```java
    private Comparator<MenuItem> byPrice = ...;
    private Comparator<MenuItem> byName = ...;
    private Comparator<MenuItem> byCategory ...;
    ```

   Note that the `...` needs to be replaced by a lambda expression that sorts by that 
   part of the class.
   
2. You may find it helpful to fill in the `csv()` function with code that loops through the
   list of menu items, and produces one line of the comma separated output.  You can see the expected
   format in the test cases. Note that you have
   to `return` this output; it does you no good to print it.
   
3. Now each of the methods is essentially a call to sort, using your comparators, followed by
   a call to the `csv()` method.

4. A reminder that comparators can be composed as follows, assuming that `byThis` and `byThat` are both
   references to `Comparator<T>` and `mylist` implements `List<T>`:

   ```java
   java.util.Collections.sort(mylist, byThis.thenComparing(byThat));
   ```
   
   You can also reverse a comparator by putting `.reversed()` after it:
   
   ```java
   java.util.Collections.sort(mylist, byThis.reversed());
   ```
   
   And this can be continued as deep as you need it to be:
   
   ```
   java.util.Collections.sort(mylist, byThis.thenComparing(byThat.reversed()).thenComparing(bySomethingElse));
   ```
   
   

# Details about methods of Menu


The methods for `Menu` are as follows:

| Modifier and Type	| Method | Description |
|-|-|-|
|`void	| add(MenuItem mi)` | add a menu item to the menu (to the wrapped `ArrayList<MenuItem>`)|
|`String`|	`csv()` | Produce a listing of each item in csv format, with newlines between each item.  Order is whatever order the items are currently in the ArrayList |
|`String`|	`csvSortedByName()` | same as `csv()`, but the items should be sorted in lexicographic order by name. |
|`String`|	`csvSortedByCategoryThenName()` | same as `csv()`, but the items should be sorted by category.  With the same category, the items should be sorted by name.  |
|`String`|	`csvSortedByCategoryThenPriceDescendingThenByName()` | same as `csv()`, but the items should be sorted by category.  With the same category, the items should be sorted by name. |
|`String`|	`csvSortedByPriceThenName()` | same as `csv()`, but the items should be sorted by price, from lowest to highest.  When more than one items has the same price, the items of the same price should be sorted by name. |


# Step 3: Checking Test Case Coverage 

As in previous labs, be sure that you've:

* added your pair partner to your submissions on Gradescope
* put your name and your pair partner's names in the README.md
* generated javadoc and put a link to your javadoc and your repo in the README.md

Then, check your test coverage: 
* Run: `mvn test jacoco:report`
* Then, open the file `target/site/jacoco/index.html` in a browser:
   * In CSIL or Phelps 3525, from your top level repo directory, use 
      either `firefox target/site/jacoco/index.html` or `google-chrome target/site/jacoco/index.html`
   * That will also work if you are ssh-ing in to CSIL, but only if you have X11 forwarding enabled.
   * If working *directly* on your own machine (i.e. not ssh-ing in), you can probably 
      just double-click on the file `target/site/jacoco/index.html` to open it.
 
Some of the points in the manual inspection may be awarded on the basis of having good test coverage.  
While 100% test coverage is not always the goal, in this particular exercise, it *should be possible*.   

So if you see that you don't have 100% test coverage, go back and write some additional unit tests.
