# Individual Track: Work on proj01

(For project track, scroll down)

If you are on the individual track, please work on proj01.

You can get help with this at the following times:

| Day | Time | Location | Notes| 
|-----|------|----------|------|
| Tue | 5-5:50pm | Phelps 3525 | Sit in BACK row only; help from Zach and Ben  |
| Tue | 6-6:50pm | Phelps 3525 | Sit in FRONT row only; help from Zach, Jacqui and Kerem |
| Tue | 7-9pm | Phelps 3526 | Open lab hours (see: <https://ucsb-cs56.github.io/w20/info/office_hours/> ) |
| Wed | 5-9pm | Phelps 2510 | Open lab hours (see: <https://ucsb-cs56.github.io/w20/info/office_hours/> ) |

You are NOT required to come to your assigned discussion section. You may if you need help, but unless
you can only come Tuesdays between 5-7pm, we encourage you to use the Open Lab Hours instead.

There are more open lab hours listed here: <https://ucsb-cs56.github.io/w20/info/office_hours/>

# Project Track

* Start with a Standup meeting.    
   * You may want to move to Phelps 2510, or outside, to keep noise levels down.
   * Record on the Team's slack channel who was present and who was absent for the standup.

* Then work on your assigned issues.

* It would be awesome if at least one individual or pair could get to the state of having a pull request ready by the end of lab.

# Mentors

* Please check in with each person/pair on the team to see how they are doing with the issue
* Offer assistance and guidance as needed.

There may or may not be industry mentors present. If there are, help them get onboarded to what the team is working on, and invite them
to give feedback on the team's process.   They may be able to help with:
* Understanding how to have an effective standup
* Understanding how to approach a new issue
* Understanding how to make appropriate commits and pull requests.
* Code review (if anyone is at that stage.)
