This lab requires you to attend and participate with your team in your assigned lab section on either {{page.due}} or {{page.due2}}
and cannot be made up, except by participation with your team over Slack.

If you are not able to attend lab, you should be in touch with your team and your team mentor (as explained many previous times during the quarter.)
