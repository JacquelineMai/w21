# This project is only for the individual lab track

This project is only for those on the "individual lab" track.  It
counts towards the project portion of your grade (20% of your final
grade, rather than the lab component of your grade.)

You may cooperate with one or more pair partners from your team to
help in debugging and understanding the project, but each person
should complete the work separately for themselves.

Late submissions will be accepted only up until grading is complete;
submissions received after grading is complete will NOT be accepted
for regrades.  To ensure that your submission is accepted, be sure
that you complete it and submit on Gradescope before the published
deadline.


# This is a Continuation of Proj01 and Proj02

In the final step, we'll add a database table for locations, and the
ability to store favorite locations in that table

# Step by step instructions

Continue with the repo and Heroku app you used for proj02, whether that's:

* Github repo: <tt>project-githubid</tt>
* Heroku App:  <tt>cs56-w20-project-<i>github</i></tt>

You don't need to create a new repo and Heroku app for proj03.   

Note that in this project, at various steps, you may need additional
`import` statements in order to implement the example code.  Figuring
out which imports those are is left as an exercise.

However, you should not need additional dependencies in your `pom.xml`
unless the instructions specifically indicate that you do.  If your
debugging steps are leading you down a road where you think you do you
need additional dependencies, ask for help; perhaps something else is
wrong.

Also: when you get the `Whitelabel Error Message` in your browser, know that the "real" error message can be found in one of two places:
* On the console output in the terminal, when you are running on localhost
* In the output of <tt>heroku logs --app cs56-w20-project-<i>github</i></tt> where the string following `--app` is the name of your heroku app.

It may be tough to find these errors among lots of other log output.
**Learning how to find it is one of the real world application
development skills we are trying to develop in this course**.  In real
application development, whether for business, industry, research,
education government, or non-profits, error messages are typically a
bit of a "needle in haystack" problem.  The sooner you develop those
skills, the more valuable and productive you will be as a software
developer.

Also know that **you are not alone**.  Use the Slack as well as open
lab hours to ask for help,

## Step 9: Add `Locations` table to your application

In this step, you'll add another database table to your application,
one that stores favoriate locations.  We'll add a button to each of
the search results that allows us to store that search result into the
database, along with the id of the user that stored it.  We'll then be
able to list both all locations, plus the "favorite" locations of the
currently logged in user.  For each of these, we'll be able to go
right to an Earthquake search for that location.

Create a feature branch with an appropriate name, prefixed with your initials, and do your work on the feature branch (not on `master`)

The database table will store locations, and it will have these fields
* `id`, which every SQL database table generally has
* `placeId`, the id that is returned by the location search API (e.g. `198134367` for the city of Santa Barbara) 
  when returned by the search at <https://cs56-w20-project-pconrad.herokuapp.com/locations/results?location=Santa+Barbara>
* `name`, the name of a location (e.g. `UCSB`, `Isla Vista`, `LAX Airport`, `Golden Gate Bridge`)
* `latitude`, the latitude of that location
* `longitude`, the longitude of that location

To add a new database table to your application, take the following steps:

1. Add an `@Entity` class.  Call this file `Location.java`, and add it under the `entities` directory, 
   just as you did for `AppUser` in the lab07 series.    
   * Note that the `App` prefix on `AppUser` was just a hack
     because `user` is a reserved word in Postgres SQL.  Normally we would have just called that class `User.java`
   * So your class is just `Location.java` not `AppLocation.java`.
2. Add a `@Repository` class.  Call this file `LocationRepository.java`, and add it under the `repositories` directory.
   * Model it after the `UserRepository` class, but instead of a collection of `AppUser` objects, it's a colleciton of `Location` entity objects.
   * You won't have a method called `findByUid`, since `uid` is not a member of `Location`. 
   * Instead, you can either:
     * define a method called `findByPlaceId` with appropriate return type, parameter type and parameter name.
     * Leave this out altogether for now, since you won't even need it unless you are planning to do the extra credit part of the project.
   (For background: in general, you can define `findByAbcd` methods for any field `abcd` that is that is part of the `@Entity` that the repo represents as part of the `interface` for the repo, and the Spring framework will automatically generate code for the class that implements the interface.    The generated code will do the correct database query.)
   
   It's probably a good idea to do a `mvn clean compile` to make sure everything still compiles before going on to the next item in the list, as well as a `mvn test`.     
3. In the `@Controller` class called `LocationsController.java`, add an endpoint `@GetMapping("/locations")`
   * The code will be similar to the code for `@GetMapping("/users")` in the `UsersController`, that is, it should
     lookup all of locations in the `LocationRepository`, and put those into an attribute of the model called `locations`.
   * It should then redirect to a view (which we'll implement in the next step) `"locations/index"`
4. Add a view in a directory `src/main/resources/templates/locations` in a file `index.html`.   
   * The code will be similar in some ways to `users/index.html` and in other ways to `locations/results.html`
   * It's up to you to figure out when to follow which model.
   * The `<title>` and `<h1>` elements should say `Favorite Locations`
   * The `<table>` that shows the locations should have columns for all of the fields that are available in an instance of the `@Entity` class `Location`.
   * The table should contain a row for each location in the locations database table.   You are iterating over the variable that was
     passed in from the `@GetMapping("/locations")` controller method.
   * If you copy/paste code from the `locations/results.html` to get started, note that an `earthquakes.osm.Place` object and a `earthquakes.entities.Location` object are not exactly the same.  Be aware of the differences when coding.  This is a possible source of confusion and errors. 
   * To be very clear: the `earthquakes.osm.Place` field names have to match, exactly, the fields in the JSON (by convention) unless we take extra steps to override the default mappings.  Thus: `place_id` vs. `placeId`, and `lat` vs. `latitude`.   
   * You'll need to refer to the `locationsRepository` inside the controller method that lists locations.  
     You'll put this into the 
     `LocationsController` in a way similar to the `userRepository` is declared inside the 
     `UsersController`.    It is declared as a private variable, and then injected into the 
     constructor.   You should code this in a similar way.

5. Try firing up the application on localhost (remember to `source env.sh` and use `mvn  spring-boot:run`).
   
   Navigate to <http://localhost:8080/locations> and see whether you get an empty list of locations.   Note that at present,
   since there are no locations in your database, you'll have an empty list. But at least you should get that, 
   and not an error.  We'll add code to put stuff in this table in a later step.
   
6. Add an item to the navigation menu that directs the user to your new endpoint that lists locations from the database.   
   The link in the menu
   should say "Favorites", but it should link to `/locations` url (i.e. the `locations/index.html` template).  You probably should add it as the rightmost menu item so that
   the relative position of the other items doesn't change (otherwise you'l have to adjust your tests).

Make sure that the code you've added so far works.   Also run `mvn test` to make sure you didn't break any existing tests.

Then merge that branch into `master`.  Deploy the master branch on Heroku, and make sure the code works on Heroku as well.

## Step 10: Add an "Add to Favorites" button on locations results page
 
In this step, we'll add an "add to favorites" button on each location result that comes up on the location list.

This button will be in a form that uses a "post" request.   We should use a "post" request because this request will
change the state on the server by adding a new record to the database.

Create a feature branch off of master for this step with an appropriate name.

1. We'll start by creating the endpoint in the `LocationsController` class.
   * The endpoint will look like this:

     ```java
         @PostMapping("/locations/add")
         public String add(Location location, Model model) {
           locationRepository.save(location);
           model.addAttribute("locations", locationRepository.findAll());
           return "locations/index";
         }
     ```
 
   * The code here takes a parameter `location` of type `Location` as a parameter.  That will get passed in from the `th:object` 
     attribute passed in in the form we create in the next item below.  

     The code `locationRepository.save(location)` adds that location to the database.
     
     Then `model.addAttribute("locations", locationsRepository.findAll());` stores an attribute `locations` in the `model`, which
     we can then iterate over.   We then direct the user to the list of locations, using the same view we already created in Step&nbsp;9.
     
2. Next, we'll add the button that invokes the `/locations/add` endpoint.  That requires us to build a form that contains
   "hidden" fields that contain the values we want to add to the database.
   
   We'll want an instance of this form inside each row of the table of location results that gets returned by the `/locations/results` 
   view.
   
   So, inside `src/main/resources/template/locations/results.html` find the part that creates each row in the table of results.
   
   The row will start with `<tr th:each="p : ${places}">` and end with the closing tag `</tr>`.
   
   You'll need to add an additional `<td></td>` element into this row at the end.  The `<form>` element will go inside this.  But for now, just add this as `<td>Add</td>`.  We'll replace that word `Add` with the form at a later step. 
   
   To give this column in the table a heading, 
   you'll want to add `<th>Add to favorites</th>` element into the matching header row at the top. 

   Do a location search, and see whether you the table of locations has an `Add to favorites` column with the word `Add` in every
   item in that column.   

   If so, do a commmit, and we'll add the `<form>` in the next step.
   
3. Now replace the word `Add` with a form element that looks like this.  You may want to first separate the `<td>` and `</td>` tags
   and put them on separate lines so that you can indent the `<form>` element inside like this:

   ```html
       <td>
         <form>
         </form>
       </td>
   ```
   The `<form>` element will look like this:

   ```html
    <form action="#" th:action="@{/locations/add}"  th:object="${location}"  method="post">
       <input type="submit" class="btn btn-primary" value="Add" />
     </form>
   ```
 
   This creates a form, but it is missing something important: the data that goes into the new object.  In this instance, that data isn't going to be typed in by the user, but instead it comes from the row of data.   To get it into the form we used what are known as "hidden fields" in HTML.  Each of those will look like this one.  

   ```html
      <input type="hidden" name="placeId" th:value="${p.place_id}" value=""/>

   ```
   
   You'll need a line like this for each of the fields `placeId`, `name`, `latitude`, `longitude`.    
   Place each of these between the `<form ... >` open tag, and the existing `<input type=submit... >` element.   
   Take note that the `name` values need to match the field names of the `Location` class (the `@Entity` class), 
   while the field names in the `th:value` expressions need to match those coming from the `p` variable, which is 
   an instance of the `earthquakes.osm.Place` class.   Be mindful of the difference between `lat` and `latitude`, for example.

   When you have made these changes, you should see a button with the word `Add` on it instead of simply the word `Add` 
   each time you do a locations search.  Clicking any of these buttons should lead you to the index pages for `Locations`,
   where you'll see that the location has been added to the database.

  
Test these changes.   If/when they work, do a commit. and then a pull request.  Merge that pull request into master.
 
**Note that certain errors in the `locations/index.html` might not show up until now.**  Since you didn't have any actual 
records in the `locations` variable until now, the code that iterated in the view over each row was never executed until now.  

So, when debugging, we are actually having to debug two things at once: 
* the code that adds items to the `locationsRepository`
* the code that lists elements in the `locationsRepository`
   
This is not ideal.   Development goes more smoothly and easily when you can focus only on one unit of code at a time; so that if something doesn't work, you are fairly sure that you know which unit of code is the source of the problem.   One way we might have proceeded instead was to make tests where we artificially added items to the `locationRepository` and then tested whether the `location/index` view properly returned those items.    

There isn't sufficient time left this quarter to explore that
approach, but I do want to note it so that you can begin to see the
advantage of writing tests, and how even though it may seem like extra
work, once you've mastered it and made it a habit, it can actually
shorten development cycles because it helps you isolate sources of
bugs sooner, and focus on one unit of code at a time.

## Step 11: Add a link from the locations index page to be able to list earthquakes.
 
You'll now see that while the `locations/results` page has a link `Get
Earthquakes` in every row, the `locations/index` page does not.
 
Your task in this step is simple: add that feature to every row of the
`locations/index` page as well.
 
I won't provide detailed instructions; by now, you should have enough
information to know how to proceed.
 
Make a feature branch and implement the feature. You may divide this among multiple commits, or do it in a single commit, as you see fit.   Test, and then do a pull request, and merge that pull request into master.

## Step 12: Add a "delete" button for each row of `locations/index`

We now have a way to add things to our favorites (the "Add" button on
`locations/results`) but we don't have a way to delete them.  In this
step, we'll add that.

Create a feature branch for the delete button.

1.  First make a controller endpoint for deleting locations.  It will look like this:

    ```
    @DeleteMapping("/locations/delete/{id}")
    public String delete(@PathVariable("id") long id, Model model) {
        Location location = locationRepository.findById(id)
                .orElseThrow(() -> new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid courseoffering Id:" + id));
        locationRepository.delete(location);
        model.addAttribute("locations", locationRepository.findAll());
        return "locations/index";
    }
    ```
   
    This will allow us to create a form that will allow us to delete a
    particular location by specifying its id right in the URL.  You'll
    need an import for the `@DeleteMapping` annoation (exactly what
    that is is left as an exercise to figure out.)

    Add in this code, and makes sure that your app still compiles and
    runs.  If so, that's worthy of a commit.

2.  The next step is to add a column to the table on the
    <tt style="background-color:#00f">/locations</tt> page
    (the "Favorites" page) with the column heading "Delete".
    
3.  Now, add an extra `<td></td>` element with the placeholder word
    `Delete` inside.  We'll replace this with a form element later.
    
    If you can see the placeholder when loading the
    <tt style="background-color:#00f">/locations</tt> page (the
    "Favorites" page), that's worthy of another commit.

3.  Now add a form element that looks like this.  
    ```html
    <form th:method="delete" th:action="@{/locations/delete/} + ${loc.id}">
         <input type="submit" class="btn btn-danger" value="Delete" />
    </form>
    ```
    
    Note that we used `btn-danger` as one of the CSS `class` values we
    added to the `input` element.  In the Bootstrap framework, this
    makes the button appear in a different color, one associated with
    delete actions.  (For more info, see [this
    reference](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/buttons/).)
    
    Each of these buttons is associated with deleting a different
    element from the database by virtue of the `${loc.id}` part of the
    `th:action` attribute, which specifies the URL to which the button
    will direct the application.
    
    Note also that we are using the `delete` method instead of the
    `get` or `put` methods.  If you are interested in the detail on
    this, this Stack Overflow answer may be of interest:
    <https://stackoverflow.com/a/24753505>.
    
    Try adding and deleting some locations to see if this code works
    properly.  Note that at present, it is possible to add duplicate
    locations (e.g. adding the city of Santa Barbara multiple times),
    however these duplicates will be distinguished by having different
    `id` values, even if they have the same `place_id` value.  So they
    can be deleted independently.
    
    An additional feature that could be added would be the ability to
    automatically check for duplicates before adding, and not adding a
    place that already exists in the database.  However, we'll not
    require that as part of this project.
    
    So, once your
    add and delete buttons work properly:
    * Test thoroughly on localhost
    * Run your `mvn test` unit tests
    * Do a commit, a pull request, and merge into master
    * Deploy from the master branch on your heroku app
    * Test again, not just the code from this step, but all the steps in this project.
    * If everything works, then we are ready for final submission of {{page.num}}!
    
# Final Steps

## Final Step 0: A few things to check

1. Look over the staff's working version here:

   * <https://cs56-w20-project-pconrad.herokuapp.com/>
   
   Compare it to your working version on Heroku.  If you see
   differences, try to determine which of these is true:
   * Is is a minor difference that doesn't matter?
   * Did the staff miss part of the instructions?
   * Did you miss part of the instructions?
   
   If you aren't sure, ask questions on Slack.

## Final Step 1: Check that your code is all on master and Heroku

* Have you pushed all changes to your last feature branch?
* Have you done a final pull request?
* Have you accepted that pull request?
* Have you deployed your master branch to Heroku?
* Do all the parts of your application work? Can you login/logout, and
  access all pages?

## Final Step 2: Update your javadoc and jacoco report

To update your javadoc and jacoco report, do this:

```
mvn clean
mvn javadoc:javadoc
mvn javadoc:test-javadoc
mvn test
mvn jacoco:report
mvn site
mvn site:deploy
git add docs
git commit -m "xx - update javadoc and jacoco report"
git push origin master
```

## Final Step 3: Check your README.md

Check that your README.md has links to
* your GitHub pages webpage, and that the webpage is published.
* your app running on Heroku

## Final Step 4: Submit on Gauchospace

Then, finally visit <{{page.gauchospace_url}}> and make a submission.

In the text area, enter something like this, substituting your repo name and your Heroku app name:

<div style="font-family:monospace;">
repo name: https://github.com/chrislee123/proj01-githubid<br>
on heroku: https://cs56-{{site.qxx}}-project-chrislee123.herokuapp.com<br>
</div>


Then, **and this is super important**, please make both of those URLs **clickable urls**.

The instructions for doing so are here: <https://ucsb-cs56.github.io/topics/gauchospace_clickable_urls/>
