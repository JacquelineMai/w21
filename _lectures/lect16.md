# Step 1: (Individual, 10 minutes)

Find your team's repo, and your contribution to it.  Read it over again, and perhaps also skim the section of the paper, to remind you about what you read,
and what you wrote.

The link to the paper is here:  <https://pconrad.github.io/files/paper028.pdf>

# Step 2: (First Breakout Group, 10 minutes)

Your first breakout group will be with other people that read the same section as you.   Look for breakout rooms labeled: `Sect 4.1`, `Sect 4.2`,
etc.  Join the appropriate group.

In this breakout room, choose one person as the "time keeper", and a second person as the "scribe".   The scribe should keep notes in a document of their own
choosing; they will copy/paste from this document into the main chat window after returning to the main room.

The timekeeper should give each member of the room exactly 2 minutes to share what they thought
the **most important takeaways** were from the paper, in terms of **what students in this class might need to learn to be well prepared for industry**.  

* The timekeeper should go last, and someone else should time them. 
* The scribe should ask someone else to scribe (in the local zoom chat window) while they give their report.   

When each person has finished, everyone should return to the main room, and the scribe can copy/paste their notes into the main 
[`#lecture`](https://ucsb-cs156-f20.slack.com/archives/C016PJSTHNX) 
channel on Slack.  

# Step 3: (Second Breakout Group, 10 minutes)

Now, join the breakout room for your team.   Each member of the team should report on their portion of the paper, starting with section 4.1, then 4.2, etc.

Again, choose a timekeeper and a scribe.

You may refer to the notes in the 
[`#lecture`](https://ucsb-cs156-f20.slack.com/archives/C016PJSTHNX) 
channel on Slack, or just report from you own memory, as you see fit.

# Step 4: (Still in Second Breakout Group, 10 minutes)

Make a list (as a group) of (at least) six learning goals you have between now and the end of the course, i.e. things that you want to "be able to do" by the end of this course.

They may relate to the six themes in the paper, or they may be different; the point is that they are things that are meaningful
to the members of your group, knowing what you know from your own experiences, as well as what you've learned from this paper.

Put that list on the Slack channel, along with a list of the names of the group members that contributed to your discussion.

When that's done, you are finished with today's discussion section.
