A few notes:
- PRs will NOT be code reviewed until they are green on CI
- If you have a PR with a red X, work on getting it green
  - If you need help ask for help with that!
- Two code reviews are needed: one from a peer on your team, and another from staff
- If you have changes requested, get those done asap
- If your PR has merge conflicts, you need to fix those.
  - The staff can guide you through that process.

Today, in your groups:

* Do the usual standup meeting
* Review the CATME peer comments
* As a group, do a quick retro (instructions below)


# Mini Retro (Allocate 12-15 minutes for this)
- Take time to review the peer feedback on CATME if you haven't yet.
- Everyone open the team slack chat
- Everyone write a message that has three things in it.  **DON'T HIT ENTER** until everyone says that they are done.
  * Stop: What is something we are doing that we should stop doing (to improve)
  * Start: What is something we are doing that we should start doing (to improve)
  * Continue: What is something we are doing that we should continue doing (because it's going well)
  If you can't think of *both* a start and stop, just one of the two is fine.
- On signal from group leader, everyone hits enter.
- Read through what people wrote, and discuss.

# Kanban board / PR review

- Make sure Kanban board is up-to-date with status of stories
- Review the PRs that are currently in review, or will be in review soon
- Wednesday midnight is the deadline to get PRs submitted
