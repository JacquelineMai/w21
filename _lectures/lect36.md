# Course Evaluations

* The goal of this course, "Advanced Applications Programming" is to help you
  * move beyond the kind of programming you did in 16/24/32
  * into the kind of programming involved in real-world software development
* Real world software development is messy
  * You have to both determine "what problem to solve" as well as "how to solve it"
  * The messiness was exacerbated by trying to scale up the size of the course to accomodate the waitlist.
* I took on an extra load to try to help ensure that the waitlisted students would not have to wait until F20 to take the course.
  * As a result, the course was certainly less well organized that it otherwise would have been.
  * I hope that you will take that into consideration when deciding on ratings for
    * Course independent of Instructor (evaluate the *course*)
    * Instructor independent of Course (evaluate the *instructor*)

The University takes course evaluations seriously.   
* They affect pay and promotion for faculty
* If you want your comments to be taken seriously, avoid profanity.
* The written comments are just as important (if not more so) than the 
  numerical ratings.
* Comments that focus on what helped or detracted fron your *learning* are the most on point.

# Instructor must leave the room while course evals are completed.

* However, please do not use this time as an opportunity for "office hours".
