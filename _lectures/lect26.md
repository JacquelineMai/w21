# Some items to discuss

* "How much of this should we be expected to know how to do"?
  - Imposter Syndrome
  - Learning from peers
  - Discovery learning vs. direct instruction
  - The skill to teach others is so valuable
  - Scaling up the help from the staff 
  - The importance of struggle 
 
* Focus first on what the story is really about.
  - Very often that's where you spend most of your time rather than the coding

* Is it cheating to use code from the internet?
  - No. That code isn't going to be plug and play.  You are going to have to tweak that code to suit your purposes.
  
* Use the slack!  
  - Ask your teammates for help before the staff
  - Use the help-general and project channels

* "I still can't get my local setup working (on CSIL, on my own machine)
  - Consider pairing with someone whose set up is working so that you can make contributions

* In team meetings: 
  - Let's talk about how a stand up goes
  - It's really important to be discussing your team's work
  - It's helpful if at least one member is sharing their screen
  - If needed, break out into multiple break out rooms.
  - You can let others control your machine in zoom
