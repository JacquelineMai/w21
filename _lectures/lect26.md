# Decisions Day (TR)

Please sit with your teams initially.


# 11-11:10 Compare your epic with the others

In lab, you explored your own team's epic and project.

While the default is to stay with your assigned team and epic,
if there is room, you may be permitted to switch to another team.

Take a moment, to look at the other Epics for your discussion section.

* Link here: <https://ucsb-cs56.github.io/w20/info/projects/>

For example, if you are in the Tuesday 5pm section, on t-5pm-a, also
look at the epics for t-5pm-b, t-5pm-c and t-5pm-d.

There is also the remote possibility to switch to a different discussion
section if and only if:
* There is a team with fewer than 6 people (i.e. there is room)
* You can commit to participating in *that* section for the rest of the quarter.

# 11:10-11:15  Look at the individual project track

The individual project track is not yet 100% ready, but it will be quite similar
to the F19 individual project track described here.  

* [proj01](https://ucsb-cs56.github.io/f19/lab/proj01/) [proj02](https://ucsb-cs56.github.io/f19/lab/proj02/) [proj03](https://ucsb-cs56.github.io/f19/lab/proj03/) [proj04](https://ucsb-cs56.github.io/f19/lab/proj04/)

Differences:
* Google OAuth rather than GitHub OAuth
* Some of the steps were already done in the starter code
* We have some new challenges to add to the later steps

But it will be quite similar.

# 11:15-11:20 Pros/Cons of the legacy code vs. individual track

There is no secret that I hope most students choose the legacy code track.

You will gain valuable skills, experience and insight from working on a legacy code project that are difficult to find in any undergraduate or even graduate course.  These skills are among the most sought out industry skills.  I beleive you'll be better prepared for job interviews for internships and permanent positions, and will be on-boarded more quickly when you start those jobs.

There are also rewards in working on code that will have a life beyond the course.  You are contributing to something real, something that will get used.

However I recognize that committing to a project team comes with challenges.   

You may have life or academic circumstances that make it difficult to make the necessary committment *for these next 3 weeks* to other team members to show up, carry your weight, communicate, etc.  This doesn't mean you aren't capable, just that *right now* isn't the right time for you.

So, there is no shame in choosing the individual project track, if that's the better choice.

## Attendance

Project Track:
* You'll need to make a committment to attending lecture and lab, since in each lecture and lab, you'll have standup meetings to coordinate with your team.   
* You'll get some time in every lecture and lab to work with your team.

Individual Track:
* You'll need to come to most lectures, but you may not need to stay for the entire time.
* Some material will still be presented that will be on the final, and the pertains to both tracks.
* For lab, you may come to either the open or closed lab sessions for help with your project.

# 11:20-11:30 Discussion in your teams

You may now discuss in your teams which option you wish to choose.  Feel free to also visit other teams that have open slots if you want to explore.

If you've already committed to the individual track, you may record that decision here:
