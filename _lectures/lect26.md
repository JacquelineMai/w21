# Some items to discuss

* "How much of this should we be expected to know how to do"?

* "I still can't get my local setup working (on CSIL, on my own machine)
  - Consider pairing with someone whose set up is working so that you can make contributions

* In team meetings: 
  - Let's talk about how a stand up goes
  - It's really important to be discussing your team's work
  - It's helpful if at least one member is sharing their screen
  - If needed, break out into multiple break out rooms.
