# New Seating Chart

Please sit according to the new MW lecture seating chart (for the rest of the quarter)

If chairs are not set up appropriately when you arrive, please set them up this way.

Please also return them to original orientation before you leave.

# Individual Track

Please start <https://ucsb-cs56.github.io/w20/lab/proj01/>

If you have questions, there is a slack channel `#proj01`; please ask your questions there.

You are encouraged to come to lecture for the remainder of the quarter, unless there is an announcment to the contrary.   Some material coverered at the start of lecture may appear on the exam, and will be relevant to both tracks.

# Project Track

* We'll discuss what a standup meeting is.  You'll have a standup meeting in your lab section tonight.
* Please be on time for your lab section.  Standup happens at the beginning and it is important to not miss it.

# Today's goals

By the end of today's lecture:
* On each group's project board, each team member should be assigned to at least one issue in the "in-progress" column.
* Start discussing the issue by making comments on the issue itself, and/or using your team's slack channel.
* Clone your project repo and make a branch for your issue
   * The project repo is one of: [ucsb-courses-search](https://github.com/ucsb-cs56-w20/ucsb-courses-search), [mapache-search](https://github.com/ucsb-cs56-w20/mapache-search) , [open-lab-scheduler](https://github.com/ucsb-cs56-w20/open-lab-scheduler) 
   * The branch name should start with your team name, and end with a summary of your issue in a few words.
   * Examples:
      * [This issue](https://github.com/ucsb-cs56-w20/mapache-search/issues/154): `w-5pm-a-landing-page`
      * [This issue](https://github.com/ucsb-cs56-w20/ucsb-courses-search/issues/149) `w-5pm-c-search-ge-mult-qtr`
   * Avoid spaces or special characters in your branch names.  It makes using the command line more difficult
   * Putting the team name at the start of the branch name is VERY helpful to the overall product/project management.
* When you make a branch for your issue, make a comment on the issue with the branch name.

# Goals for tonight in lab

* **Prepared for Standup** 
   * Arrive early or at least on time (top of the hour)
   * Be ready to describe
     * What you are working on
     * Any roadblocks to progress
     * What you hope to have done by the next standup
* **Acceptance Criteria on All in-progress Issues**
   * Example: [This issue](https://github.com/ucsb-cs56-w20/mapache-search/issues/154)
   * Discuss acceptance criteria with your UCSB mentor
   * If that mentor is busy, ask a TA, or a fellow team members
   * Definitely slack your UCSB mentor to ask for feedback on acceptance criteria when done.     
* **Ready to engage industry mentors in your work **
   * Not all teams will have industry mentors this week, but some will
   * Be ready to explain your issue, and to "think aloud" as you work.
   * Be ready to show them acceptance criteria, or to do a "think aloud" about coming up with those.

# What happens next

* You continue working on your issue until it meets all of the acceptance criteria
* Then do a pull request, and drag issue into the "in review column"
* Add comment to the issue with link to the PR
* Slack your mentor to ask them to review the PR
   * They will **either** merge it, and record recommended points in a repo called, for example, `FEEDBACK-w-5pm-a`
     (private, read-only access for only your team), and drag it into "Done"
   * **Or** they will request changes in the code, drag it back to "in progress", and notify you via slack.
   * MONITOR YOUR KANBAN BOARD and your team's slack channel to stay informed of the progress of your issues.
