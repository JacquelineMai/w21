# Today's goal

By the end of today's lecture:
* On each group's project board, each team member should be assigned to at least one issue in the "in-progress" column.
* Start discussing the issue by making comments on the issue itself, and/or using your team's slack channel.
* Clone your project repo and make a branch for your issue
   * The project repo is one of: [ucsb-courses-search](https://github.com/ucsb-cs56-w20/ucsb-courses-search), [mapache-search](https://github.com/ucsb-cs56-w20/mapache-search) , [open-lab-scheduler](https://github.com/ucsb-cs56-w20/open-lab-scheduler) 
   * The branch name should start with your team name, and end with a summary of your issue in a few words.
   * Example:
