Today, we are looking at the process of working on real application such as:

* <https://github.com/ucsb-cs56-w20/ucsb-courses-search>
* <https://github.com/ucsb-cs56-w20/mapache-search>
* <https://github.com/ucsb-cs56-w20/open-lab-scheduler>

We'll look at EPICS (collections of stories)

We'll then look at the STAFF-lab07-dev repo (in progress, still private) and the Kanban board process.

Then, we'll look at the structure of:

* adding OAuth
* doing a pull request
* adding in Admin table
* adding in a Users table
* APIs
* more database operations
