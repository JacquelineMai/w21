# Adding our teams on GitHub

* Navigate to <https://github.com/ucsb-cs56-w20>
* Click Teams button at top
   * This should take you to <https://github.com/orgs/ucsb-cs56-w20/teams>

* The staff has to add the first member of your team as a maintainer.
   * After that, the maintainer should add one other members as a maintainer.
   * Then the two of you together can add all the rest as maintainers.

# Create a repo for the team

One of you should now create a private repo called, for example:
* TEAM-t-5pm-a
* TEAM-t-5pm-b
etc.

All caps `TEAM` followed by hyphen and then your team name.

Then, go to settings, and give your team read/write access to the repo.
