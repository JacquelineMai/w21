Demo with lab06

# Start on Databases in Spring Boot

* We'll be using our lab06 code as a starting point
* Then I'll be applying steps from lab07c from F19
   * NOTE: I'll be reordering the steps in lab07a,b,c and proj01,02,03,04 for W20
   * So they are useful as reference, but don't start work until I say they are ready.
