Today we start work on the three projects for the course:

| Section | Project Repo |
|-|-|
| 5pm | <https://github.com/ucsb-cs156-f20/proj-ucsb-courses-search> |
| 6pm | <https://github.com/ucsb-cs156-f20/proj-ucsb-cs-las> |
| 7pm | <https://github.com/ucsb-cs156-f20/proj-mapache-search> |
{:.table .table-sm .table-striped .table-bordered}


Each of your teams has a Kanban board, shown in this table:

| | 5pm | 6pm | 7pm|
|-|-|-|-|
| a | [F20-5pm-a]({{page.5pm_url}}/3) | [F20-6pm-a]({{page.6pm_url}}/3)|  [F20-7pm-a]({{page.7pm_url}}/3)|
| b | [F20-5pm-b]({{page.5pm_url}}/4) | [F20-6pm-b]({{page.6pm_url}}/4)|  [F20-7pm-b]({{page.7pm_url}}/4)|
| c | [F20-5pm-c]({{page.5pm_url}}/5) | [F20-6pm-c]({{page.6pm_url}}/5)|  [F20-7pm-c]({{page.7pm_url}}/5)|
| d | [F20-5pm-d]({{page.5pm_url}}/6) |[F20-6pm-d]({{page.6pm_url}}/6)|  [F20-7pm-d]({{page.7pm_url}}/6)|
{:.table .table-sm .table-striped .table-bordered}

In the "todo" column, on each of your pages, there is one issue that is labelled as an "Epic".   

This issue should remain in your "todo" column on your board throughout the remainder of the course.   You can refer to it to come up with the issues that you'll work on throughout the remainder of the quarter.


# Project Points

The project phase is worth 40% of your grade (see discussion from [Lecture 2](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/f20/lectures/lect02/) and the newly updated [Syllabus](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/f20/info/syllabus/)

In addition, we’ll be using peer evaluations through a tool called CATME to assess your individual contributions to the project’s success. The peer evaluation may apply a multiplier to your project grade, increasing it or decreasing it, per your team’s assessment of your contributions. It is important to be sure that you are meeting your committments to your team for a variety of reasons; your grade is among those.

Project points will be earned by contributing to one of the three open source legacy code projects. You’ll be assigned to a project team, and the project team will be assigned to a set of bug fixes and feature requests. This mirrors real world software development practice.

To earn a “perfect score” (100%) for this 20% component of your grade, your team needs to earn 100 project points. If you only earn 80, then an 80% will be recorded for that 20% of your grade.

Some assignments in the project category are worth more points, and some worth fewer.

If you accumulate more than 100 project points, up to 10 project points may be used to raise your final average in the class up to 2.0 points. (The points will be recorded as extra credit). (Each point raises your final course average by 0.2% ).

You may not earn more than 110 total project points–any points in excess of 110 will not count towards your grade (though you’ll probably learn a lot from having under taken the work to earn them.)
