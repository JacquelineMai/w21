Today we start work on the three projects for the course:

| Section | Project Repo |
|-|-|
| 5pm | <https://github.com/ucsb-cs156-f20/proj-ucsb-courses-search> |
| 6pm | <https://github.com/ucsb-cs156-f20/proj-ucsb-cs-las> |
| 7pm | <https://github.com/ucsb-cs156-f20/proj-mapache-search> |
{:.table .table-sm .table-striped .table-bordered}


Each of your teams has a Kanban board, shown in this table:

| | 5pm | 6pm | 7pm|
|-|-|-|-|
| a | [F20-5pm-a]({{page.5pm_url}}/3) | [F20-6pm-a]({{page.6pm_url}}/3)|  [F20-7pm-a]({{page.7pm_url}}/3)|
| b | [F20-5pm-b]({{page.5pm_url}}/4) | [F20-6pm-b]({{page.6pm_url}}/4)|  [F20-7pm-b]({{page.7pm_url}}/4)|
| c | [F20-5pm-c]({{page.5pm_url}}/5) | [F20-6pm-c]({{page.6pm_url}}/5)|  [F20-7pm-c]({{page.7pm_url}}/5)|
| d | [F20-5pm-d]({{page.5pm_url}}/6) |[F20-6pm-d]({{page.6pm_url}}/6)|  [F20-7pm-d]({{page.7pm_url}}/6)|
{:.table .table-sm .table-striped .table-bordered}

In the "todo" column, on each of your pages, there is one issue that is labelled as an "Epic".   

This issue should remain in your "todo" column on your board throughout the remainder of the course.   You can refer to it to come up with the issues that you'll work on throughout the remainder of the quarter.


# Project Points

The project phase is worth 40% of your grade (see discussion from [Lecture 2](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/f20/lectures/lect02/) and the newly updated [Syllabus](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/f20/info/syllabus/)

In addition, we’ll be using peer evaluations through a tool called CATME to assess your individual contributions to the project’s success. The peer evaluation may apply a multiplier to your project grade, increasing it or decreasing it, per your team’s assessment of your contributions. It is important to be sure that you are meeting your committments to your team for a variety of reasons; your grade is among those.

Project points will be earned by contributing to one of the three open source legacy code projects. You’ll be assigned to a project team, and the project team will be assigned to a set of bug fixes and feature requests. This mirrors real world software development practice.

To earn a “perfect score” (100%) for this 20% component of your grade, your team needs to earn 100 project points. If you only earn 80, then an 80% will be recorded for that 20% of your grade.

Some assignments in the project category are worth more points, and some worth fewer.

If you accumulate more than 100 project points, up to 10 project points may be used to raise your final average in the class up to 2.0 points. (The points will be recorded as extra credit). (Each point raises your final course average by 0.2% ).

You may not earn more than 110 total project points–any points in excess of 110 will not count towards your grade (though you’ll probably learn a lot from having under taken the work to earn them.)

# Breakout room activities


Choose a leader and a scribe.  The scribe should share their screen (you may need the latest version of Zoom 5.3.1 to be able to share screens in breakout rooms.)

We want to accomplish two things today:

* **Consolidating Teams By Time Zone**.   Determining what time zones everyone is in.   
  * It may be helpful to reshuffle team membership to consolidate people in the same time zone, if that is possible.
  * Note that there are also benefits to being in different time zones (multiple shifts of work) as long as you are able to coordinate well.
* **Turning Epics into Stories**.  We want to break up the epic into different stories, and get each story into a separate issue on the Kanban board.
  This will help us be ready on Monday to start work on these stories.

# Time Zone Coordination

Scribe: First, go to your team's channel (e.g. `#team-5pm-a`, `#team-5pm-b`, etc.)

Each member of the team: determine what time zone you are in, and the GMT/UTC offset. You may be able to [ask Google "What time zone am I in?"](https://www.google.com/search?q=what+time+zone+am+i+in) and get this information.

Time zones are expressed both with a name such as "Pacific Standard Time", "India Standard Time", "China Standard Time" as well as a GMT or UTC offset (these mean the same thing.)  

Examples time zones:
- Pacific UTC-8
- Eastern UTC-5
- India UTC+5:30
- China UTC+8    

Ask each member of the team to type into the team's channel their time zone (name and UTC offset).

Scribe: compact this information into one line where you just tally up how many individuals are in each time zone, and post it to the channel `#section-5pm`, `#section-6pm` or `#section-7pm` as appropriate.

```
Pacific(UTC-8): 3  Eastern(UTC-5):1  China(UTC+8): 2  
```

# Team Changes

There are two kinds of team changes that may be done at this point:
* 1-for-1 swaps
*
