List of Team Assignments: <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/w21/info/teams/>

Yesterday in lecture:
* You got to know your teammates
* You discussed some of the thing that help to make good teams.   

# Today's Team Activity

This activity works with the paper that you were assigned to read during lecture yesterday.

You do not need to have read the whole thing for today, but you need to have at least skimmed it.

Here's the link: <https://pconrad.github.io/files/paper028.pdf>

Our focus will be Section 4, which is divided into 6 sections:

| Section | Title | Academia | Industry | 
|---------|-------|----------|----------|
| 4.1 | What: Differences in Scope | well-defined, fixed scope | vague, open-ended, evolving scope |
| 4.2 | When: Short vs. Long Time Spans | short time spans (days, weeks)  | long time spans (months, years) |
| 4.3 | Who: Individual vs. Large Team | individuals, pairs, small groups  | larger teams |
| 4.4 | Why: Learning vs. User Needs | to learn something  | to address a user need |
| 4.5 | How: Ad-Hoc vs. Professional | ad-hoc tools and practices |  professional tools and formal practices |
| 4.6 | How Big: Small vs. Large Codebases | small programs | large complex systems |

You'll first assign one person from your team to each section; most teams have six people, so that's team member per section.

You might use the team slack channel, and use first-come, first-served, or some other way to divide up the sections.

If you have fewer than six team members, you can decide to leave one section uncovered.  (If one or more team members is absent,
put a slack message in your team channel mentioning them by `@`-ing them, and letting them know which section(s) are left
to be claimed.)

Then, you'll elect one member of the team as the team scribe (a different one from last time) that can share their screen.

That member of the team should go to the repo for your team on GitHub.  Here are links to these repos:
