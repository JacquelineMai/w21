For Monday Discussion on 10/05/20, we worked on <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/f20/lab/jpa00/>.

Most students finished it by the time lab was finished at 7:50pm (55 out of 68).

Here's the Gauchospace post that preceeded the class meeting:

Dear CS156 Students:

Here's how today's discussion section will work.

Our goal today is for everyone to try to complete Java Programming Assignment 00 (jpa00).

The assignment is ready now, and you may begin right away. 

Here's the link: <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/f20/lab/jpa00/>

Although Slack has been only "intermittently" reliable today, to the extent possible, monitor the #jpa00 slack channel for updates on jpa00.

Today's lab has a lot of reading, and possibly a lot of new stuff to get used to, but not a lot of actual Java programming.   It likely will take you very little time to complete (unless something goes wrong that we didn't anticipate.)

If you complete it before your assigned discussion section time and have a score of 100% on Gradescope, you don't need to show up for discussion today (though you are still welcome to do so if you want to ask questions of the LAs, TAs, or the instructor.)

PLEASE NOTE that this is not necessarily how future discussion sections will work; this is just for today.   In future weeks, we will often have group work for you to do.

On the other hand, if you have not completed the lab before your assigned discussion section starts, we ask that you "attend" (via Zoom) and work on the lab.

* We'd like to try to recreate the learning environment that happens in the physical labs, where we have groups of the students working simultaneously.   This allows us to help folks efficiently.
* We'll put you in your team breakout rooms; you can use this as a place to ask fellow students for help if you run into problems while working on the lab.
* One new feature is that you should be able to move yourself between and among breakout rooms.  In addition to having breakout rooms for the teams, we'll also have breakout rooms where you can ask for help, or ask questions about the course
* For today only, if you like, you may join the zoom room earlier than your assigned discussion section time, and if you like, stay longer than your assigned discussion section.  (Whether we do that in future weeks depends on what we are doing, and how well it works out today.)

If all of the plumbing works with this lab, we'll be able to move on to more interesting Java labs, and introduce a few JavaScript labs within the next few days.

See you soon!
