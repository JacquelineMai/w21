# You should be on Slack

It's important to be registered on the Slack.  One of the important skills we're learning in this course is professional communication, as it relates to software development.  The Slack channel will be our primary vehicle for that.

Important information will be disseminated there.   

There are clients for [iOS](https://slack.com/downloads/ios), [Android](https://slack.com/downloads/android), [Windows](https://slack.com/downloads/windows), [MacOS](https://slack.com/downloads/mac) and [Linux (.deb and .rpm)](https://slack.com/downloads/linux).

Or you can just use the web at <https://ucsb-cs56-w20.slack.com>

If you aren't on the Slack, get on the Slack!


# lab02: Hello World for Spring Boot, Heroku

In this lab, we'll get a web app up and running on both localhost and Heroku

* <https://ucsb-cs56.github.io/w20/lab/lab02>

A few things that the lab covers and that we might discuss briefly in lecture

* web page/site vs. web app
* port numbers
* localhost vs. Heroku
* Ant vs. Maven
