# Software to Install or Configure


## Recommmended for Everyone

1. UCSB VPN Client (Pulse Secure)

   What it does:
   * Reroutes all your network traffic through the UCSB network, so that it appears that
     your machine is directly connected to the UCSB Campus network

   What it allows you to do:

   * Access the textbooks for the course online without having to buy them.
   * Mount your CSIL home directory as a shared network drive using Samba

   Where to get it:  <https://www.it.ucsb.edu/pulse-secure-campus-vpn/get-connected-vpn>

2. Samba Access to your CSIL home directory

   What it does:

   * Mounts your CSIL home directory "as if" it were connected directly to your
     computer.


   What it allows you to do:
   * Click on files on CSIL and open them in software on your own machine
     (e.g. an editor such as Sublime Text, VSCode, or a web browser.)

   Where to get it:
   * You don't have to download anything (though you do need the UCSB VPN Client first)
   * Instead, follow the instructions here:

3. VSCode Text Editor for your local computer

   While `vim` and `emacs` are perfectly fine for the work you may have done in CS16/24/32, when it comes to 
   professional level application development, it's time to graduate to some more professional tools.
   
   We have found that VSCode (a free download for Windows/Mac/Linux) is in the sweet spot between too few features, and too complicated.
  
   If you haven't worked with it before, we suggest you download it and start getting used to it.
   
   What it does for you:
   * Autocompletion
   * Syntax highlighting and checking
   * Automatic import detection
   * Ability to see an entire directory tree at once
   * Search and replace across multiple files
   * and much much more...
